# GLFW3d Graphical Computing
## Libraries needed:
- GLFW lib
- OpenGL version 3.30 (at least)
- GLM (OpenGL Mathmatics)
## Concept
  This is a OpenGL project that was designed thinking about the completion of a first 3D graphical program. It runs in C++, and because of that it's compatible with pretty much any kind of operational system (that supports keyboard inputs and have graphics card)
## Compilation
### GNU/Linux:
> In order to compile, you need to have *build-essential* , *glfw*, and *opengl*. Copy the code below in order to download them:
>`sudo apt install build-essential libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libgl-dev git`
> Right after, you should clone this repository inside any folder in your PC, using the command
> `sudo git clone <LINK OF THIS REPOSITORY>`
> Then, once inside the repository folder, you should type the command `make` in order to compile & execute.
> If you have any kind of problem with the makefile, you can type `cat Makefile` and manually compile the program.

### WINDOWS:
> For windows you should use any configured IDE for C/C++ compilation in order to compile it into an executable.
